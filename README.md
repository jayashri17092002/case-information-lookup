# case-information-lookup
This project is a court case lookup system where users enter a case number and CAPTCHA to fetch details from a backend database. It validates the CAPTCHA, sends data to the backend, retrieves case info, and displays it. The system also fetches case history periodically and handles errors for failed submissions.
